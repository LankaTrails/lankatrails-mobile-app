# Favorite Button Implementation

## Overview

The favorite button functionality has been successfully integrated into the header section of all service detail pages. This provides a consistent and accessible location for users to add/remove services from their favorites.

## Implementation Details

### HeaderSection Component

- **Location**: `components/explorer-components/HeaderSection.tsx`
- **Type**: TypeScript React component with proper interface definitions
- **Props**:
  - `showFavorite?: boolean` - Controls visibility of favorite button
  - `isFavorite?: boolean` - Controls heart icon state (filled/empty)
  - `onFavoritePress?: () => void` - Callback function for favorite action

### Integration across Service Pages

All service detail pages now include the favorite button in their header:

1. **Transport Services** (`app/(tabs)/explore/services/transport/[serviceId].tsx`)
2. **Accommodation Services** (`app/(tabs)/explore/services/accommodation/[serviceId].tsx`)
3. **Activity Services** (`app/(tabs)/explore/services/activity/[serviceId].tsx`)
4. **Food & Beverage Services** (`app/(tabs)/explore/services/food-beverage/[serviceId].tsx`)
5. **Tour Guide Services** (`app/(tabs)/explore/services/tour-guide/[serviceId].tsx`)

### Usage Pattern

```tsx
<HeaderSection
  title={serviceDetail.serviceName}
  onBack={() => router.back()}
  showFavorite={true}
  isFavorite={isFavourite}
  onFavoritePress={handleFavourite}
/>
```

### HeaderSection Interface

```tsx
interface HeaderSectionProps {
  title?: string;
  onBack?: () => void;
  showFavorite?: boolean;
  isFavorite?: boolean;
  onFavoritePress?: () => void;
}
```

### Favorite Functionality

Each service detail page includes:

- **State Management**: `isFavourite` boolean state
- **Handler Function**: `handleFavourite()` with platform-specific toast/alert feedback
- **Visual Feedback**: Heart icon changes color and fill based on favorite status
  - Unfavorited: Empty heart with teal (#008080) color
  - Favorited: Filled heart with red (#ef4444) color

### State Management Code

```tsx
const [isFavourite, setIsFavourite] = useState(false);

const handleFavourite = () => {
  setIsFavourite((prev) => {
    const newState = !prev;
    if (Platform.OS === "android") {
      ToastAndroid.show(
        newState ? "Added to favourites" : "Removed from favourites",
        ToastAndroid.SHORT
      );
    } else {
      Alert.alert(newState ? "Added to favourites" : "Removed from favourites");
    }
    return newState;
  });
};
```

### Removed Components

- Previous floating favorite buttons overlaid on image galleries have been removed
- All image gallery sections cleaned up to remove `relative` positioning and favorite button overlays

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Uniform favorite button placement across all service types
- **Accessibility**: Always visible in header, not dependent on scrolling to images
- **Clean Design**: Removes floating overlays from image galleries
- **Better UX**: Immediate access to favorite functionality from page header
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces ensure compile-time error checking

## Technical Notes

- HeaderSection component converted from JavaScript (.jsx) to TypeScript (.tsx)
- Proper TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- All compilation errors resolved across all service pages
- Heart icon from `lucide-react-native` with consistent styling
- Header favorite button size: 28px (larger than previous 24px for better accessibility)

## Future Enhancements

### Backend Integration

- Connect to favorites API endpoint
- Persist favorite status across app sessions
- Sync favorites with user account

### Additional Features

- Favorites page/screen to view all saved items
- Favorite count display
- Quick add/remove from search results
- Favorites-based recommendations

### UX Improvements

- Haptic feedback on favorite toggle
- Animation on state change (scale/bounce effect)
- Loading state during API calls
- Batch favorite operations

## Usage

The favorite button automatically appears in the header of all service detail pages when `showFavorite={true}` is passed to the HeaderSection component. Users can tap to toggle the favorite status, which is immediately reflected in the UI with visual and platform-appropriate feedback.
