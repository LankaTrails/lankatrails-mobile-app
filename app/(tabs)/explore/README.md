## Overview

The explore module has been restructured for better modularity and maintainability following React Native routing best practices.

## New Folder Structure

```
app/(tabs)/explore/
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx                    # Main explore layout with route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx                      # Search/Home screen (unchanged)
â”œâ”€â”€ search/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx               # Search section layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ results.tsx               # Search results (formerly searchResult.tsx)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [future components]   # Search-specific components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx               # Services section layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [serviceId].tsx           # Service detail view (formerly ServiceView.tsx)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ provider/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [providerId].tsx      # Service provider page (formerly ServiceProviderPage.tsx)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ServiceGrid.tsx       # Service grid component (extracted)
â”œâ”€â”€ categories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx               # Categories layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [category].tsx            # Category listing (moved from root)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [future components]   # Category-specific components
â”œâ”€â”€ places/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx               # Places layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [placeId].tsx            # Place detail view (new)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ PlaceGrid.tsx        # Place grid component (extracted)
â”œâ”€â”€ support/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx              # Support section layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ complaints.tsx           # Complaints page (formerly ComplainPage.tsx)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ help.tsx                 # Help page (placeholder)
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ MapSelector.tsx          # Map selector (formerly MapSelectorComponent.tsx)
    â””â”€â”€ shared/                  # Shared explore components
        â”œâ”€â”€ AnimatedCard.tsx     # Reusable animated card (extracted)
        â”œâ”€â”€ SectionHeader.tsx    # Section header component (extracted)
        â””â”€â”€ LoadingStates.tsx    # Loading state components (extracted)
```

## Key Changes

### 1. **Modular Components**

- Extracted reusable components into separate files
- `AnimatedCard`, `SectionHeader`, `LoadingStates` are now shared components
- `ServiceGrid` and `PlaceGrid` are domain-specific components

### 2. **Better Routing Structure**

- Services: `/explore/services/[serviceId]` (instead of `/explore/ServiceView`)
- Places: `/explore/places/[placeId]` (new route for place details)
- Provider: `/explore/services/provider/[providerId]`
- Search Results: `/explore/search/results`
- Categories: `/explore/categories/[category]`
- Support: `/explore/support/complaints`

### 3. **Component Organization**

- Domain-specific components in their respective folders
- Shared components in `components/shared/`
- Each section has its own layout file for nested routing

### 4. **Legacy Files Status**

The following files remain in the root for backward compatibility:

- `accommodation-foods-transport.tsx/.jsx`
- `FoodItemView.tsx`
- `ServiceViewCopy.tsx`

These should be migrated to the new structure in future updates.

## Migration Guide

### For Navigation Updates:

- Update service navigation from `/explore/ServiceView` to `/explore/services/[serviceId]`
- Update place navigation to `/explore/places/[placeId]`
- Update search results navigation to `/explore/search/results`

### For Component Usage:

- Import shared components from `../components/shared/`
- Import domain components from their respective folders
- Use modular loading states instead of inline components

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily shared across screens
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and update specific features
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features within each domain
5. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support with organized imports
6. **Performance**: Smaller bundle sizes with code splitting

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed

- [x] **Modular folder structure** with domain separation
- [x] **Nested routing system** with proper layouts
- [x] **Reusable components** (AnimatedCard, SectionHeader, LoadingStates)
- [x] **Service and Place grids** extracted to separate components
- [x] **Updated navigation paths** to new route structure
- [x] **Search results functionality** fully migrated
- [x] **Two-level filtering system** (category â†’ sub-type)
- [x] **"View all" button redirection** to filtered tabs
- [x] **Hidden headings** in filtered tabs for cleaner UI

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- [ ] **Testing new route structure** and fixing any remaining routing issues
- [ ] **Performance optimization** of component renders

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

- [ ] **Add error boundaries** for better error handling
- [ ] **Implement unit tests** for extracted components
- [ ] **Add more domain-specific components** as needed
- [ ] **Update API documentation** for new component interfaces
